# Football Summer Transfer Analysis


This project aims to analyze the dataset of the football summer transfer season of 2022/2023. The dataset contains information about player transfers between clubs during this transfer window. The analysis performed in this project provides valuable insights into player movements, transfer fees, and other relevant metrics.


# Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis was found in https://www.kaggle.com/code/ruslanhuretski/eda-2022-23-football-summer-transfer-window and is focused on the football summer transfer season of 2022/2023. It includes information about player transfers such as the player's name, their previous club, their new club, transfer fees, and other relevant details. The dataset is in a structured format, such as a CSV file, to facilitate data processing and analysis.

# Goals

The main goals of this analysis project are as follows:

**Player Movements:** Identify the players who changed clubs during the summer transfer window. Determine the number of players involved in transfers and the distribution of transfers across different clubs and leagues.

**Transfer Fees:** Analyze the transfer fees associated with player transfers. Calculate statistics such as the average transfer fee, the highest and lowest transfer fees, and the distribution of transfer fees across different clubs and leagues.

**Player Performance:** Explore the performance of transferred players in their new clubs. Analyze relevant performance metrics, such as goals scored, assists provided, and other performance indicators, to understand the impact of transfers on player performance.

**Club Strategies:** Investigate the strategies employed by clubs during the transfer window. Identify clubs that made significant investments in transfers and examine the correlation between transfer spending and on-field performance.

# Methodology

To achieve the above goals, this project utilizes Tableau and Python programming language with libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, allowing for efficient data manipulation and analysis. The following steps are involved in the analysis process:

Data Loading: The dataset is read into a pandas DataFrame, enabling easy access and manipulation of the data.

Data Cleaning: The dataset is cleaned to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and any other data quality issues that may affect the analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Various exploratory data analysis techniques are employed to gain insights into the dataset. This includes calculating summary statistics, creating visualizations, and identifying patterns and trends.

Player Movements: The analysis determines the number of players involved in transfers and provides a breakdown of transfers across different clubs and leagues. Visualizations such as bar charts or pie charts may be used to illustrate these distributions.

Transfer Fees: Transfer fees are analyzed to determine the average, highest, and lowest fees. Visualizations like box plots or histograms may be employed to showcase the distribution of transfer fees.

Player Performance: Relevant performance metrics for transferred players are analyzed, providing insights into their performance in new clubs. Statistical measures, such as mean, median, or correlation coefficients, may be utilized to quantify the performance impact.

Club Strategies: The analysis investigates the relationship between transfer spending and on-field performance. Correlation analysis or regression models may be used to determine if higher transfer spending leads to improved performance.
